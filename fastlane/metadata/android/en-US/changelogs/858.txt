14.7:
Block editor: Added Column block and Starter Page template for blogs. Adjusted Starter Page Template buttons to avoid overlap with page content. “Choose media from device” opens a built-in WordPress media picker instead of your device’s default picker.

Bug fixes: A bug causing URL settings to appear when changing device orientation while previewing Starter Page Templates.

UI improvements: Added your Gravatar to the Me menu in My Site.
